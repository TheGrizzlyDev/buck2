# Observability for Buck2 OSS

## Context

In large organizations building software is a fundamental part of a developer's journey and can significantly impact productivity. As such, being able to monitor and debug builds is a fundamental ability every user and power-user must have. 
This ability is further limited by the remote nature of CI builds where instances are usually remote and most of the times inaccessible due to security requirements (see SLSA L2 and above).
